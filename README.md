### _United States education spending over time._
## Why are you interested in this field/domain?
There are a lot of interesting questions to be asked about the education spending
throughout the past 3 decades, such as how nation social or political events
affect different counties and states differently. Did Washington increase
education spending in response to President Bill Clinton's illegal immigration
reform more than Texas did? How has the education spending by district in New
York changed over the years, with respect to gentrification? Performing this
data analysis would allow us to have a convenient resource that allows us to
answer questions such as this.
